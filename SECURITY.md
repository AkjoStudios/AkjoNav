# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As we don't have any dev releases yet and there aren't even any public release in sight yet, there are no supported versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

If you still find a security vulnerability in the code and dependabot hasn't dete.cted it yet, you can create an issue with the labels `type: vulnerability`, `status: in review` and `priority: critical`.
Describe exactly where and how the vulnerability could be exploited. 
We generally look at security vulnerabilities first so you should see them fixed pretty quickly. If you already know how to fix it, well then you know what to do ;)
